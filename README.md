Getting Started

# Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. Download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en
# Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/kharthicsj/Employee-Management-Backend.git

# Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:
cd employee-management-backend
npm install
  
Alternatively, if you prefer yarn:
yarn install
  

## Environment Variables:

This project utilizes environment variables to store sensitive configuration details like database connection strings and authentication keys. Create a file named .env in the project's root directory with the following format:

VARIABLE_NAME1=value1
VARIABLE_NAME2=value2

 
### Important: 
  Do not commit the .env file to your version control system (e.g., Git). Refer to your Node.js environment variable loading mechanism for specific instructions on how to access these variables in your code.

Example:

JavaScript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
or 
import env from dotenv;

**dotenv.config();**

const databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
console.log(databaseUrl);
  

## Start the Development Server:

Configure the appropriate database connection details in your .env file.

### Run the development server using a command like:
npm start  **Or** yarn start
  
The exact command and port may vary depending on your setup. Refer to the project's code for specific instructions.

Building Your Application

### API Documentation:
Refer to the API documentation (generated tools like Swagger are recommended) for detailed information about API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
## Front-End Integration: 
The API is designed to be consumed by various front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular). Use the API documentation and HTTP client libraries to build your front-end application that interacts with the backend API.Use (Axios) Framework to access the backend code
